"df.iloc[df['Review string length'].idxmax()]['Review']"
This part was a bit hard to understand.

breaking down the code:

df['Rewview string length'].idxmax()
This is used to find the index of the maximum value in the column. The idexmax() returns the index corresponding to the max value specified in the column.

df.iloc
In this, iloc[..] is used to locate the row of the specified index

now combining all these lines of code, we get the value of the row with the highest string count
