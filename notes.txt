1. 
"df.iloc[df['Review string length'].idxmax()]['Review']"
This part was a bit hard to understand.

breaking down the code:

df['Rewview string length'].idxmax()
This is used to find the index of the maximum value in the column. The idexmax() returns the index corresponding to the max value specified in the column.

df.iloc
In this, iloc[..] is used to locate the row of the specified index

now combining all these lines of code, we get the value of the row with the highest string count


2. 
"plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.histplot(df['Review string length'], bins=50, kde=False)
plt.xlabel('Review string length')
plt.title('Review string length distribution')
plt.show()"

for the first line, it just creates a new figure for the plot by specifying the width and the height: figsize=(width, length)

for the second line,
#histogram is the graphical representation of the distribution of data
the second line is basically used to create a histograph for a particular data which in this case is for the Review string length
in here we create a histogram for the plot using the data of the Review string length, with 50 bins(bars) and kde set to False (he KDE is a way to estimate the probability density function of the underlying distribution.
If kde=True, a smooth curve will be overlaid on the histogram, providing an estimate of the probability density of the data.)





KDE(Kernel Density Function)  #https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5zLaWT5KPs
- Kernel Density Estimation is the estimation of an unknown PDF(Probability Density Function) given some data


To use the deployed model


import joblib

loaded_clf = joblib.load('restaurant_review_model.pkl')
X_new = cv.transform(["Enter the data here(review)"]).toarray()
predictions = loaded_clf.predict(X_new)
print("Predictions:", predictions)
